## üß† Concept Summary

`SmartCacheAlloc` is a memory management strategy designed to reduce RAM pressure in high-performance applications (especially servers) by **offloading rarely-accessed dynamic memory blocks into fast NVMe storage**, and **restoring them on-demand**.

It offers a hybrid between traditional `malloc()`/`free()` and a software-level cache/paging system ‚Äî but at the application level, **without relying on the OS kernel's virtual memory manager**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Offload malloc‚Äôed blocks** to NVMe when inactive or oversized
- ‚úÖ **Restore** them to RAM when accessed again
- ‚úÖ **Reduce memory leaks** by keeping track of ownership and block lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Works on any Linux system with NVMe ‚Äî no custom drivers required
- ‚úÖ Enables large-memory workloads on machines with limited RAM

## üî¨ Architecture

```text
[RAM malloc'd block] ‚Üí [Marked inactive] ‚Üí [Serialized to .cache file on NVMe]
                                            ‚Üì
                           [Freed from RAM to release pressure]
                                           ‚Üì
                            [On reaccess ‚Üí Loaded back to RAM]
