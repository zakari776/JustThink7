## 🧠 Concept Summary

`SmartCacheAlloc` is a memory management strategy designed to reduce RAM pressure in high-performance applications (especially servers) by **offloading rarely-accessed dynamic memory blocks into fast NVMe storage**, and **restoring them on-demand**.

It offers a hybrid between traditional `malloc()`/`free()` and a software-level cache/paging system — but at the application level, **without relying on the OS kernel's virtual memory manager**.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Offload malloc’ed blocks** to NVMe when inactive or oversized
- ✅ **Restore** them to RAM when accessed again
- ✅ **Reduce memory leaks** by keeping track of ownership and block lifecycle
- ✅ Works on any Linux system with NVMe — no custom drivers required
- ✅ Enables large-memory workloads on machines with limited RAM

## 🔬 Architecture

```text
[RAM malloc'd block] → [Marked inactive] → [Serialized to .cache file on NVMe]
                                            ↓
                           [Freed from RAM to release pressure]
                                            ↓
                            [On reaccess → Loaded back to RAM]
